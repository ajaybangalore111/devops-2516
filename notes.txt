            -> DevOps unites "Software Development" & "IT Operations" teams 
                to "Deliver Softwares Faster" & "More Reliable".

        -> Any Application You want to build 

            -> Development Team [ Application is still on Laptop Of Developers, dev, qa servers ]

                    -> Software Testers 
                    -> etc 

            -> Operations Team

                -> To Deliver/Deploy Applications [ Application is running on Production servers i.e end users ]

                    -> Cloud Admin

            -> Development == Cooking Food 

            -> Operations  == Serving Food 

            -> Cook Food ===> Server Food [ Develop ===> Deploy ]

            -> Before DevOps these teams were working in isolation and if something
                goes wrong in Delivery / Deployment "BLAME GAME STARTS"
